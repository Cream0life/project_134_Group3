                <p>Located just a few minutes from the attractions of downtown Toronto, like CN Tower, Eaton Centre is a must-do when you’re exploring the city’s centre. This iconic Toronto mall is a great place to start or end your downtown trip, with plenty of places to eat and shop.</p>
                <p>Today this shopping centre and office complex is the fourth largest in Canada. It features multiple levels with a galleria style vaulted glass ceiling, a design which has been copied in various forms in malls throughout North America. The centre is also connected to a 17 storey Marriott hotel.</p>
                <p>Apart from the appealing styles inside the mall, there are significant outside landmarks as well such as Yonge-Dundas Square and Nathan Phillips Square. Free Wi-Fi is available for public use throughout CF Toronto Eaton Centre, though a Facebook account, Twitter account, or email address is required to gain access to it.</p>

                <p>At Eaton Centre, several fibreglass geese perpetually fly along the ceiling. This is one of artist Michael Snow’s installations that makes visiting Eaton Centre so special. The ceiling itself is quite a sight, too, with a beautiful skylight giving way to a view of the weather outside. </p>
                <p>It’s not just the architecture that’s interesting—Eaton Centre is also home to several flagship and experiential shops that make it a great place to visit, even if you don’t intend on buying anything. At the Samsung Experience Store, shoppers can take a trip through a mesmerizing display of technological feats.</p>
