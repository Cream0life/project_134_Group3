        <pre> 
            From crystals to dinosaurs, the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) covers it all, making it an 

            essential stop on any kind of traveller's itinerary. Originally opened in 1914, the <abbr title="Royal Ontario Museum">ROM</abbr> 
            
            now houses numerous permanent collections and is always curating interesting feature 

            exhibits. With the futuristic addition of the Michael Lee Chin crystal in 2007, the ROM 

            is an attraction that stands the test of time for visitors of all ages.

            <p>Opened in 1914, the <q><abbr title="Royal Ontario Museum">ROM</abbr> </q> showcases art, culture, and nature from 
            
            around the globe and across the ages. One of North America's most renowned cultural 
            
            institutions, Canada's largest museum is home to a world-class collection of more than 
            
            six million objects and specimens, featured in 40 gallery and exhibition spaces. </p>

            <p>The beautiful, attention-grabbing facade, inspired by the museum's own gem and mineral collection, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all ROM  (100 Queens Park) has to offer. The museum’s exterior, a.k.a. the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was quickly dubbed the 'crystal' because of its crystalline shape. The structure resembles an actual crystal right on the streets of Toronto! Visitors to the museum are reminded of the chunky geometry of a mineral up close—which they can view at the museum—as they walk through the doors of ROM.

            The striking exterior welcomes you into a vast museum filled with exhibits that speak to 
            
            Ontario's past, present and future identities. With respect to <mark>First Peoples art and 
            
            culture, as well as a broad collection from all around the world </mark>, ROM is considered one 
            
            of the continent's most important cultural institutions. Spend the day hanging out with 
            
            dinosaurs, travelling to ancient Egypt, and learning about the continuing First Peoples 
            
            legacy, among other adventures. ROM houses 13 million objects spanning art, culture, and 
            
            nature from around the world and across the ages. If you have just one afternoon to spend
            
            in Ontario, buy a ticket and hop on the bus to ROM, located right in the heart of Toronto's
            
            downtown.</p>
